# CatchDisksMR
A simple HoloLens demo game about catching falling cassettes. 

This is a simple unity demo where you use the tap and hold gesture on the crate to move it and catch falling cassette tapes. 

More documentation coming soon! Feel free to download and look through the code. I encourage checking out [Holographic Academy](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/academy)
to learn more about developing with holograms!
